# Software Engineering for Scientific Computing

## APC 524 / AST 506 / MAE 506

The goal of this course is to teach basic tools and principles of writing good
code, in the context of scientific computing. Specific topics include an
overview of relevant compiled and interpreted languages, build tools and source
managers, design patterns, design of interfaces, debugging and testing,
profiling and improving performance, portability, and an introduction to
parallel computing in both shared memory and distributed memory environments.
The focus is on writing code that is easy to maintain and share with others. You
will develop these skills through a series of programming assignments and a
group project.
