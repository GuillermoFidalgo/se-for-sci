# Version Control

## Intro to git

Good practice in programming project management requires a version control system. 

Old school techniques are usually bad.

- Version filenames is a disaster
    - mythesis_v1.tex, mythesis_v2.tex, mythesis_last_v3.tex
    - create clutter
    - Filenames rarely contain information other than chronology
    - Parallel independent changes super hard to keep track of
    - Did you finally notice a problem in v119 that has been around for a while, but you have no idea where the error was introduced?

- Sharing files with others is a disaster
    - Emailing files sucks --- only magnifies the problems above
    - Track changes feature Google Docs or Word --- not so useful for anything complex

- Disaster recover is a disaster
    - Oh F#@K! Did I just overwrite all my work from last night??!!!?
